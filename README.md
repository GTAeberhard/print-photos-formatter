# Print Photos Formatter

The Print Photos Formatter is a simple tool which resizes an image to different
smaller sizes and positions these onto the original image.

This tool was created for home-made photo albums where different sizes of a
single photo should be printed (with e.g. a photo print services), so that
there are several size options for a single photo when designing the home-made
album.
